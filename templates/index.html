                            This year, we’re returning to <b>Detroit</b> for the first time since MHacks III. <a
                                href="http://www.themasonic.com/" target="_blank">The Masonic Temple</a> in Detroit is
                            the largest in
                            the world and is located in the heart of the Motor City. Built in 1922, this historic
                            building is the perfect setting for a weekend in a city thriving with renewed
                            entrepreneurial spirit. We hope you use this energy and atmosphere to drive your hacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A change of venue gives us a chance to increase our attendance to 2,000 hackers, which
                            allows us to grow the MHacks community. In doing so, we’re able to provide the support our
                            hackers need to discover hacking and develop their skills alongside teammates, mentors,
                            competitors, and friends.

                            This Fall, we’re also going to focus on wellness. Sometimes, hackathons have been notorious
                            for unhealthy food, sleep deprivation, and uncomfortable hacking spaces. And we don’t think
                            it should take two weeks to recover from one. We will have healthier food options, sleeping
                            spaces, and more health life hacks to keep you feeling your best during the weekend, and
                            after.
